v2.0.0 - 2025-05-11
-------------------

The package has been adopted by the SublimeText GitHub org and now lives at
<https://github.com/SublimeText/Terraform/> for the community to maintain.
This is accompanied by many changes
to bring the syntax definition up to current standards,
courtesy of @deathaxe, @FichteFoll, and @michaelblyons.

In summary, the syntax has been aligned with current standards
as they have developed over time for the default syntaxes
and various other third-party syntaxes.
For a detailed list of changes,
please refer to the full changelog at
<https://github.com/SublimeText/Terraform/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>.

Note that this release is only compatible with ST builds 4180 and higher.
The old version is still available for installation on older builds
but is not maintained anymore.
